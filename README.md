# eAppointment

eAppointment Project with Asp.Net Core Api 8.0 Clean Architecture;

* I performed the tests using AspNet Core 8.0 ,Swagger and Postman via the API.
* I used Clean Architecture as the architecture and included 4 layers under a single Solution in the project.
* I used CQRS, Mediator and Repository design patterns in Design Pattern.
* I used MSSQL as the database and created tables and maintained relationships using migration with code first approach.
* For the security of the project, I prevented unauthorized role access by using Json Web Token.
* I gained experience working with different libraries by using SmartEnum and GenericRepository libraries.
